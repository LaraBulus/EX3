This project I implemented a game with maps and robots and fruits on them.
The goal of this game is to eat as much fruit as possible.
The game has 2 modes:
- Automatic
- Manual

The goal of the automatic mode is to eat as much fruit as possible - for this goal, I used the algorithms from exercise 2  (Dijkstra, shortest path, etc).
The manual mode the user can play by himself with a mouse click on the robot he wants to move and another click on the vertex that the robot will move to (Provided the vertices are neighboring).

Another option that I implemented its to export a KML file at the end of the game.
When the game is to finish the system ask the user if he wants to save a KML file.
In case and the user click yes. the system gives it to him a KML file and then the user can upload the KML file to  [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com) and see the original map with all him moves.
.
This tuturiel will help you to upload the KML file to google earth:
